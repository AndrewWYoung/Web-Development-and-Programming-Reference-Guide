# Web Development and Programming Reference Guide
A basic multipage static site with notes from various courses (or websites) I've previously taken. Its a small project to not only experiment with CSS and JavaScript, but will also allow to experiment with designs. It also allows me to organize my notes since they are scattered throughout various folders and different text documents.

## Reference Guide Includes:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Python
5. Java

__Note:__ More technologies will be added as I become proficient with the previously listed languages.

## Contribution
Feel free to add your own themes and practice CSS. I may even add another section for page layouts/themes so everyone can contribute to get some practice with GitHub. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to let me know.
